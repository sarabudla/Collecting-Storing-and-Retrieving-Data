# Collecting-Storing-and-Retrieving-Data

Through my academic, I have developed competencies in the following areas:

* Collected data from a variety of sources using R.
* Cleaned and transformed data into effective storage structures in R.
* Classified information and data storage approaches based on object type and retrieval requirements.
* Selected appropriate information storage structures depending on object type and analysis goals.
* Planned an information repository for data analysis and discovery.
* Discussed how NoSQL databases can be applied to store and retrieve unstructured data.
* Completed simple implementations of structured and unstructured data repositories using R.
* Used SQL to store and retrieve data from relational databases.
* Transformed data objects into representations suitable for data analysis platforms.
* Distinguished between storage needs for statistical and non-statistical analysis of data.
* Outlined tiered information architectures for efficient data retrieval and search.
* Applied knowledge from case studies to select, plan, and implement information repositories.
* Analyzed data through exploratory visualization.
* Identified outliers and transformed data for predictive analytics.
* Constructed simple predictive analytics models using techniques like time series forecasting, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and k-NN.
* Evaluated and tuned predictive models.
* Worked within a reproducible analytics pipeline following the CRISP-DM process.

These skills were developed and honed through a combination of coursework, independent study, reflecting a broad and deep understanding of data analysis and management principles.
